# Assignment 6: Polymorphic shellcode

- Use 3 shellcode samples from Shell-Storm.
- Create polymorphic versions of all three to defeat pattern matching
- End result can not be more than 150% of the original shellcode size
- Bonus points for results smaller than the original

## Disclaimer

I did not write the assembler code in any of the files suffixed with
-original.asm. Please refer to both the files themselves and the blog
post associated with this assignment. To my knowledge, I followed the
original author's license requirements and credited them properly.
